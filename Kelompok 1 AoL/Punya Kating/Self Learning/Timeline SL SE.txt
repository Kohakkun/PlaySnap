*SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT*
You are required to make an application. You are free to choose what type of application (web based, mobile etc.) Your application should have a novelty, meaning should have some features that are not available in the current existing application. Should have 5 features (or more).

At the end you will submit a technical report containing the following:

*SL 1*
_I. Introduction/Background – session 2_
a) Why did you choose to make this software.
b) What is(are) your new feature(s) (which is not available in other similar application)

*SL 2*
_II. Description of the software – session 12_
a) Describe your software and its features.

*SL 3*

*SL 4*
_IV. Project Management_

*SL 5*
_VI. Effort Estimation (Using FP Analysis) – session 5_

*SL 6*
_II. Description of the software – session 12_
b) Use Case Diagram (of the overview - not details) 
c) One activity diagram of one Use Case (your choice) Should represent the main function in your application
d) Class Diagram

*SL 7*
_VIII. Create a Risk table for your project. – session 13-14_
